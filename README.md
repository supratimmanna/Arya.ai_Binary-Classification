# Arya.ai_Binary-Classification 
# Data Analysis:
### 1. Check if there is any categorical value or not
### 2. Check if the data set is balanced or not.
### 3. Check if there is any null value in the data set or not.
### 4. Check the rangle of the values of different variable and if needed then normalize the values.
### 5. Check the statistical summary of the data set.
### 6. Plot the histogram of each variable to beter understand the data and their distribution.
### 7. Calculate correlation between each pair of variables to check if there exists any highly correlated variables in the data set or not.
### 8. For a better visualization, plot the heat map of the correlation value.
### 9. Plot each variable with respect to the target variable to check how they differ from claas to class.

# Model Selection:
### 1. Select several classification models to test their performance on the given training data set.
### 2. Plot their classification performance to check which model's performance is better.
### 3. Select the model with best performance for the final training.

# Model Training:
###1. Split the given data into training set and validation set with a ratio of 4:1.
